# Investigating the tooth growth dataset
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
# set seed to make research reproducible
set.seed(1000)
# Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 
library(datasets)
hist(ToothGrowth$len)
hist(ToothGrowth$dose)
table(ToothGrowth$supp == "VC", ToothGrowth$len > 18.81)
table(ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ", ToothGrowth$len > 18.81)

plot(ToothGrowth$len~ToothGrowth$dose)
library(ggplot2)
exp_plot <- ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(supp~.)
exp_plot

# Provide a basic summary of the data.
str(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)

# Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques 
# from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
# H_0 <- mean(dose) == 1.167
# H_a <- mean(dose) > 30


# State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
