## Inference
In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
# set seed to make research reproducible
set.seed(1000)
# setting the theo_mean = 1/lambda which is the theoretical mean and standard deviation for an exponential distribution
lambda <- 0.2
# setting n = 40 as set by the spec
n <- 40

# Will illustrate the central limit theorem through running different amounts of simulations
# By running 1, 10, 100, and 1000 simulations we will observe that as n (the number of 
# observations) increases the difference between the theoretical mean and standard deviation
# with the mean of the sample mean and standard deviations will converge to 0

# 1 Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
