## Executive Summary
In this project I will investigate the mtcars dataset that comes with R. As noted in the data dictionary for this problem
"The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobie 
design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models)." 

I will address the following points:
“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?” 
  - manual is better

"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions" 
 - on average a car with manual transmission will get 7.245 mpg


```{r, echo = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
# always set seed to make research reproducible
set.seed(1000)
# inspect dataset
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
# boxplot for automatic transmission
boxplot(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am == 0])
# boxplot for manual transmission
boxplot(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am == 1])

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
library(ggplot2)
mpg_trans_plot <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + xlab("weight") + ylab("MPG") + facet_grid(.~am)
mpg_trans_plot
# clearly lower weight manual transmission cars have the highest mpg ratio

mpg_fit <- lm(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ am)
summary(mpg_fit)

# in quantifying the difference betwwen manual and automatic transmission I will assess the mean, median, and standard
# deviations for each of two optins

tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$am, median)
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$am, mean)
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$am, sd)

```
